## Part I: The K-Mathematics Framework

### 1. Introduction to K-Math

K-Mathematics (Kharnita Mathematics, or K-Math) is a symbolic-harmonic system for analyzing recursive digital structures. It models computational processes as dynamic operator systems rather than static functional evaluations. This allows it to identify resonant behaviors, convergence attractors, and emergent vulnerabilities in cryptographic and computational systems.

K-Math extends classical logic by introducing **operator-agency**, **recursive harmonic layers**, and **Crown Omega closure (\Omega^\circ)**. These tools define new classes of systemic analysis beyond Boolean and algebraic reduction.

### 2. Core Constructs

#### 2.1 Operator Space (\mathbb{O})

Let \mathbb{O} be the set of all deterministic operators in a closed system. For SHA-256, this includes: logical functions (`Ch`, `Maj`), rotations, and modular additions.

#### 2.2 Operator-Agency

An operator O \in \mathbb{O} exhibits **agency** if its behavior recursively depends on and modifies future system states:
[ O(S_t) \to S_{t+1} \to O' = f(O, S_{t+1}) ]
This recursive dependency creates emergent, self-modifying behavior.

#### 2.3 Recursive Closure: Crown Omega (\Omega^\circ)

Define \Omega^\circ as the total limit of recursive operator action:
[ \Omega^\circ(S_0) = \lim_{n \to \infty} (O_n \circ O_{n-1} \circ \dots \circ O_1)(S_0) ]
It captures the total emergent state of a system under full recursion.

#### 2.4 Harmonic Convergence and \lambda-Operators

Define \lambda as a transformation mapping a system into a resonance field:
[ \lambda: S \to R \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n ]
When applied to multiple inputs, if:
[ \Vert \lambda(S_1) - \lambda(S_2) \Vert \to 0 ]
it indicates a **Resonant-State Violation (RSV)**.

### 3. K-Math vs Classical Systems

| Classical Cryptography | K-Math Perspective                     |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Bitwise logic          | Recursive operator influence           |
| Static compression     | Emergent attractor evolution           |
| Collision = random     | Collision = systemic convergence (RSV) |

## Part II: SHA-256 Under K-Math

### 4. Standard SHA-256 Compression

SHA-256 processes input in 512-bit blocks, using 64 rounds of nonlinear mixing and 8 internal state variables (a-h). Its structure assumes ideal avalanche effect and entropy diffusion.

### 5. Structural Weakness

K-Math reveals that SHA-256’s round functions are **not perfectly dissipative**. When subjected to structured inputs, resonance develops across state variables.

## Part III: Resonant-State Violation (RSV) Attack

### 6. Summary

Construct distinct message sequences {m_{1,i}}, {m_{2,i}} such that:
[ H(m_1) = H(m_2) ]
not by random collision, but by recursive, guided convergence.

### 7. Attack Steps

**Step 1:** Apply \Omega^\circ to map SHA-256 constants (H0) into harmonic potential fields.
**Step 2:** Construct initial blocks m_1, m_2 with controlled delta.
**Step 3:** Use \lambda-guided steering to shape \Delta H_i after each round:
[ \Delta H_i = H_i(m_1) - H_i(m_2) ]
**Step 4:** Adjust block deltas to minimize \Delta H_i, forcing state convergence.

### 8. Theorem: Existence of RSV

**Theorem 1.** Let H be the SHA-256 compression function. Then \exists ; m_1 \neq m_2 : H(m_1) = H(m_2) via RSV.

**Proof Sketch:**

1. H is constructed via iterated \mathbb{O}-operators.
2. These admit non-random resonant patterns under \Omega^\circ mapping.
3. \lambda-transformed trajectory of state vectors yields a measurable convergence path.
4. Result: collision through structured input, not brute force.

## Part IV: Complexity Analysis

| Method          | Est. Complexity |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| Birthday Attack | O(2^128)        |
| RSV (K-Math)    | O(2^64)         |

\Omega^\circ is parallelizable. Real-world attack requires \sim2^64 operations—tractable for state actors.

## Part V: Consequences and Remediation

* Bitcoin / Blockchain = compromised integrity
* Certificates = forgeable
* Archives = falsifiable

**Proposed Solution:** SHAARK (Structured Harmonic Authentication & Adaptive Resonant Keying)

* Injects \Omega-random entropy
* Applies non-linear steering per block
* Inhibits harmonic alignment

## 9. Conclusion

K-Math proves SHA-256 can be structurally broken. The RSV attack is not theoretical fluff—it is a new class of convergence-based cryptanalysis. This paper is the complete disclosure.
