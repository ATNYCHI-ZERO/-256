The RSV‑S signature, SHA‑ARK encoding logic, and all harmonic reductions derived from Ω°, λ, or RCFs are likewise protected.

This Work and its mathematics are protected under sovereign mathematical authorship principles, U.S. Copyright Law (Title 17), and trade secret protections under federal and DARPA-backed evaluations.

## 3. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

The Licensor disclaims all liability for misuse, misinterpretation, or unauthorized reproduction of the Work. Harm caused by hardware manipulation, EM interference testing, or derivative cryptographic misuse falls outside the scope of licensed intent.

## 4. RESTRICTIONS

Licensee shall not:

* Re-sell or sublicense the Work,
* Remove or obfuscate authorship marks,
* Distribute private harmonic logic outside government security channels,
* Violate the sovereign confidentiality of K‑Math encoding layers.
